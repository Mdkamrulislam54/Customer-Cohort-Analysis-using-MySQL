# 📊 Customer Cohort Analysis Project
# 🎯 Objective
Use MySQL to group customers into cohorts and analyze their behavior over time—tracking metrics like purchase counts, active customer counts, and revenue trends to uncover retention patterns and inform business strategy.

 # 💼 Business Context
By segmenting customers based on their first purchase month and monitoring cohort performance, businesses can evaluate retention, campaign effectiveness, and customer lifetime value. Visualization in Power BI enhances clarity for stakeholder decision-making .

# 🛠️ Methodology & Workflow
1. Data Import & Cleansing

Loaded transactional retail data into MySQL.

Cleaned the dataset for accuracy in cohort tracking 
2. Defining Cohorts

Assigned each customer a “first purchase month” value.

Tracked subsequent monthly activity by comparing transaction timestamps to first purchase date
3. Key Metrics Computation

Invoice Counts by Cohort – Number of transactions per cohort each month.

Customer Counts by Cohort – Unique active customers over time.

Revenue by Cohort – Total spend generated by each cohort monthly
4. Rate Calculations

Computed growth/decline rates for invoice counts, customer counts, and revenue to highlight cohort trends
5. Power BI Visualization

Exported data into Power BI dashboards for intuitive visual analysis of retention and revenue patterns

Revenue trends: Identify which customer cohorts drive the highest LTV.

Strategic targeting: Focus re-engagement efforts on cohorts showing early declines and capitalize on high-performing cohorts during peak periods like holidays

# 🧩 Why It Matters
Delivers data-driven understanding of customer retention over time.

Enables segmented strategy, tailoring campaigns to specific customer groups.
